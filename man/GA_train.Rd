\title{
Train a Logistic Regression Model Using Genetic Algorithm for Feature Selection
}
\description{
This function trains a logistic regression model using a genetic algorithm to select the most relevant features from the provided training dataset. It evaluates feature combinations based on their performance in predicting the response variable.
}
\usage{
GA_train(trainingset)
}
\arguments{
  \item{trainingset}{
A data frame containing the training data. The first column should be the response variable (a binary outcome), and the remaining columns should be predictor variables.
}
}
\details{
The function utilizes a genetic algorithm to optimize feature selection. The fitness function evaluates combinations of features based on the area under the ROC curve (AUC) from logistic regression models fitted to the selected features. The final model is selected based on the best feature combination identified by the genetic algorithm.
}
\value{
A fitted \code{glm} object representing the final logistic regression model with selected features.
}
\references{
Refer to relevant literature on genetic algorithms and logistic regression for more information on the methodologies used.

\examples{
# Example usage:
# Set a random seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# Create a sample training dataset
train_data <- data.frame(
  res = factor(sample(c(0, 1), 100, replace = TRUE)), # Response variable
  var1 = rnorm(100),
  var2 = rnorm(100),
  var3 = rnorm(100),
  var4 = rnorm(100)
)

# Train the model using GA_train function
final_model <- GA_train(trainingset = train_data)

# Print summary of the final model
summary(final_model)
